    "    Our comapny is considering investing in aircraft for both commercial and private use. \n",
    "    Given the inherent riskas assocaited with aviation example, accidents, equipment failure and external factors, a comprehensive risk assessment is necessary.\n",
    "    This proposal outlines data driven approach to evaluate aviation safety based on historical accident data.\n",
    "    This will help us identify aircraft models with the lowest risk profiles and  factors contributing to aviation accidents.\n",

    "**Business Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Investing in aircraft presents significant finacial and operational risks.\n",
    "    Aviation accidents can lead to high costs, reputational damage and legal challenges.\n",
    "    currently our company needs to understand:\n",
    "             1. Which aircraft models have the lowest accident rates.\n",
    "             2. The most common risk facotrs leading to accidents, eg weather, human error, mechanical failure.\n",
    "             3. How data driven analysis can reduce the risk of investment.\n",
    "    By using historical accident data, this project aims to provide actionable insights that guide decision making and risk mitigation for aircraft investment.\n",
